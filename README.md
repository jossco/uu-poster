uu-poster
=========

(Xe)LaTeX class for scientific posters, in the style of Uppsala University

Reasonably straightforward class for creating multi-column posters with title, sidebar, optional footer, and flowing text. If you want text or graphics to appear in a more complicated arrangement of boxes, you have to manually position them using the flowfram package, which is moderately painful.

Requires the a0poster and flowfram packages.
